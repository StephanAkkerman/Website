This project was my bachelor thesis for 2021, it is my biggest individual project thus far, and also the most complex project I have done.
The project consists of multiple parts of which the most important part is the reinforcement learning agent, powered by TensorFlow.
The other parts of this project consist of a heatmap for technical analysis indicators and a script to fetch data of the Binance exchange.
